# Shaarli-sidebar-theme
Simple Shaarli theme that adds a tag sidebar.

Essentially a fusion of [ManufacturaInd's 2004licious theme](https://github.com/ManufacturaInd/shaarli-2004licious-theme) and the shaarli default theme (except with an alphabetical tag list, if I can get it to work).

#### Current Status
Tag list won't alphabetise, for Unknown Reasons. Suggestions appreciated!  
Mobile view is ugly, but it does work.
